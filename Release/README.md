## Features

- Set the number of lemur buddies you want and trying to summon any more than that will juice up the existing fellows.

- Supports any modded elites!

- Lemurians will switch between the various high tier elite types once they are fully evolved.

- Fully functional and configurable scoreboard entry for all the lemurs you control. 

- Lemurians will drop 1 scrap of the corresponding tier for each unique item that they had on death, ignoring duplicates. They will remove their contribution to the shared inventory on death.

- Stat multipliers per fusion, similar to dronemeld, while still retaining the vanilla HP and damage buffs that they would get on evolution.


### *(WORK IN PROGRESS, COMING SOON)*

- Can make them share a single inventory or have their own unique inventories with a limited amount of item sharing.

- Multiple elite types on a single guy.


---
## Config

- Most balance related features are configurable.

- Added some fun/quality of life config options.

- Future plans will be to make it even more customizable and developed with mod compatability in mind.
