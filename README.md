## Features

- Set the number of lemur buddies you want and trying to summon any more than that will juice up the existing fellows.

- Designed to be a full scale rework but still compatible with all other mods

- Cracked af AI! Uses predictive aiming, actively dodges, strafes and jumps projectiles while continuing to fight back.

- Rebalancing of stats and scaling for better survivability later on.

- Stat multipliers per fusion, similar to dronemeld, while still retaining the vanilla HP and damage buffs that they would get on evolution.

- Supports any modded elites!

- Fully supports RiskyMod Ally changes!

- Lemurians will switch between the various high tier elite types once they are fully evolved.

- Fully functional and configurable scoreboard entry for all the lemurs you control. 

- Lemurians will drop their tributed items on death and will remove their contribution to the shared inventory on death.

- Death mechanics and tribute blacklist are fully configurable.

- Lemurians can use the vanilla shared inventory or have an inventory entirely to themselves.

- ... And much, much more! Nearly all features are configurable.


### *(WORK IN PROGRESS, SOME FUTURE PLANS COMING SOON)*

- Overlap attack dodging (for Mithrix specifically)

- Multiple elite types on a single guy.

- Resize Lemur buddies based on fusion count
